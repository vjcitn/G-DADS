# G-DADS: Bioconductor Data and Analysis Development Services

## Introduction

The Bioconductor software/data/annotation ecosystem has a 20-year
track record of delivering capabilities to genome data scientists.

The ecosystem has grown through community software and data contributions,
along with core team work on infrastructure and content to keep pace with
rapid developments in genomics, genome biology, and computational methods.

Components introduced in 2022 include

- A [BSgenome representation](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.T2T.CHM13v2.0.html) of the [telomere-to-telomere human genome build](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987)
- A [SNPlocs representation](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/data/annotation/html/SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38.html) of dbSNP 155
- [crisprVerse](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/crisprVerse.html) a group of packages supporting design of CRISPR experiments [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.488824v2)
- a C++-based toolkit for [alternative splicing analysis](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SpliceWiz.html) [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.05.498887v1)

The current set of contributions under review can be seen at the
[contributions github issues page](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues).

G-DADS has been conceived to support enhancements to the ecosystem, and
to simplify its use.

## Resources

- 50 TB S3-compatible highly accessible storage in Open Storage Network
- A substantial allocation of time on a system of Linux VMs and associated
storage comparable in usability to AWS EC2/EBS
- An allocation of time on GPUs associated with these VMs
